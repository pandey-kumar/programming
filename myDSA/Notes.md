# Programming Paradigm

1. Brute force  (exploring all Possiblities)> generally recursion is needed

2. DP     (optimisation)
3. Greedy
4. Divide and Conquer  DNC



## Lets discuss about Brute force for recursion

>we remove irrelevent calls
>we trace the path for an answer and revert it for the other possiblities
